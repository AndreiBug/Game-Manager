# Project Name

## Description
This project is a Spring Boot application using an H2 database for managing data. The application is designed to demonstrate the configuration and persistence of data in an embedded database while enabling user-friendly access and schema management through Hibernate.

## Features
- H2 database with file-based persistence
- Hibernate for ORM and schema management
- Accessible H2 console for database inspection
- Configurable `spring.datasource` properties for flexibility

## Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Configuration

### Database Configuration
The application uses an H2 database configured for file-based persistence. The relevant properties are defined in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
# Database URL
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:file:C:/Facultate/Anul III/I/AWJ/awj/project_awj

# H2 Driver class
spring.datasource.driverClassName = org.h2.Driver

# Database Username
spring.datasource.username = sa

# Database Password
spring.datasource.password =

# Enable H2 console
spring.h2.console.enabled = true
spring.h2.console.path = /h2-console

# Hibernate configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
spring.jpa.generate-ddl = true
spring.jpa.database-platform = org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
```

### H2 Console Access
To access the H2 database console, navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```
Use the following credentials:
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:file:C:/Facultate/Anul III/I/AWJ/awj/project_awj`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: *(leave blank)*

## Usage
1. Start the application.
2. Navigate to the H2 console to inspect the database and perform queries.
3. Utilize the Spring Boot endpoints to interact with the applicationâ€™s features (details can be added as per implementation).

## Troubleshooting
### Database Reset
If the database resets unexpectedly, ensure:
- The `spring.datasource.url` points to a valid file path.
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is set to `update` or `validate`.
- No code in the application explicitly drops or resets the schema.

### Permissions
Verify that the application has read/write permissions for the database file location.
